It's a plugin based on creating realistic fake players.
This plugin allows you to do several things. Here are the available options

・Connect Fake Player 
You can connect them to the server you want, choose their name and their skins.

・Interact with them
You can push them, tap them, make them talk. By asking questions in the chat or generating fake discussion

・Teleport Fake Player
You can also teleport them to fixed or completely random locations.



This plugin was made for a server, so it is unfortunately impossible to download it for the moment.
